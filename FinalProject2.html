    <h3>Causes of Climate Change</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>Long-term shifts in temperatures & weather patterns.</li>
        <li>Such shifts can be natural but has been primarily driven by human activities <strong><em>since 1800s</em></strong>.</li>
        <li><span id="ghg" onclick="showInfo()">Greenhouse gases</span> emissions lead to <b><em>climate change</em></b>.</li>
        <ul id="ghg-info" style="display: none;">
            <li>Such as carbon dioxide and methane act like a blanket wrapped around the earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperature. </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    Due to <i><b>climate change</b></i>, we have faced so many extreme weathers till now.</p>
    <h3>Extreme Weather</h3>
    <p>Extreme weather refers to weather events that are significantly different from the average weather pattern for an area. These events can be disruptive and even deadly, affecting human communities, agriculture, and ecosystems.
    There are two main types of extreme weather:
    <ol>
        <li>Weather-related events: These are shorter incidents like tornadoes, deep freezes, or heat waves.</li>
        <li>Climate-related events: These last longer or are caused by a buildup of weather-related events over time. Examples include droughts caused by long dry spells or wildfires caused by an extended drought.</li>
    </ol>
    Extreme weather events can be caused by natural cycles like La Niña or more immediate influences like high-pressure systems. However, they are becoming more likely because of the climate crisis caused by the human emission of greenhouse gases.<br><br>
    During La Niña events, trade winds are even stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia. Off the west coast of the Americas, upwelling increases, bringing cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.
        These cold waters in the Pacific push the jet stream northward. This tends to lead to drought in the southern U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. During a La Niña year, winter temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North.

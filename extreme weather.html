    <h3>Drought</h3>
    <p>A drought is defined as "a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack of water to cause serious hydrologic imbalance in the affected area." Famous droughts around the globe happened in history are <b><em>Great Drought</em></b>, happened in North America from 1276 to 1299, <b><em>Great Famine</em></b>, in India from 1876 to 1878, and <b><em>North China Famine</em></b> from 1876 to 1879.
    Impact of a drought are as follows: 
    <ul>
        <li>Visible signs of drought : Crop damage, lowered lake levels, increased soil erosion, reduced flow of rivers and streams, increased dust storm prevalence, and increased wildfire risk.</li>
        <li>Major economic impacts : crop loss, habitat damage, increased costs for food and water, reduced hydropower output with rising utility rates. </li>
        <li>Social Impacts : Increased human health, reduced incomes, rise in drought-related deaths, increased migration </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Heat Waves</h3>
    <p>Heat waves are periods of unusually hot weather lasting at least two days. They occur when temperatures rise above the average for a specific area. Heat waves can be deadly, causing the human body to overheat, which can lead to organ damage. The deadliest heat wave on record occurred in Russia in 2010, killing up to 56,000 people.
    <ul>
        <li>Cause: Often caused when hot air becomes trapped over an area by a high pressure system.</li> 
        <li>Health Risks: Overheating can cause the blood to thicken, forcing the heart to pump harder and putting it and other organs at risk for damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hurricanes, Typhoons and Cyclones</h3>
    <p>Tropical cyclones are storms that form over tropical or subtropical waters, characterized by a rotating circle of clouds and thunderstorms. They are classified based on their maximum sustained wind speed into tropical depressions, tropical storms, and tropical cyclones. These storms are known by different names in different regions. They can cause heavy winds, large waves, heavy rains, and flooding. The deadliest tropical cyclone on record was Cyclone Bhola in 1970, Cyclone Nargis in 2008 and so on.

    <h3>Tornadoes</h3>
    <p>A tornado, also known as a twister, is a violent atmospheric storm characterized by a rapidly rotating column of air. They can have wind speeds over 250 mph and can clear a path a mile wide and 50 miles long. Tornadoes are most common in the U.S., particularly in an area known as Tornado Alley. The deadliest tornado in U.S. history was the Tri-State Tornado of 1925.

    <h3>Wildfires</h3>
    <p>Wildfires, unplanned and uncontrolled fires in natural areas, can start naturally or due to human activity. They spread based on conditions like high temperatures, wind speeds, and low precipitation. While wildfires can benefit ecosystems by aiding seed germination and clearing out dead vegetation, increased fire activity can strain ecosystems and communities.
        Some examples of historical wildfires are: 
        <ul>
            <li>2003 Siberian Taiga Fires in Russia, which burned 55 million acres of forest.</li>
            <li>1919/2020 Australian Bushfires, which scorched 42 million acres of land and killed over 30 people.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Winter Storms</h3>
    <p>Winter storms, which can include blizzards and ice storms, are dangerous weather events involving heavy snow, blowing snow, and severe wind chill. Blizzards combine heavy wind with blowing snow, reducing visibility, while ice storms involve the accumulation of ice on surfaces, making travel dangerous and potentially causing damage. The deadliest winter storm in U.S. history was the Great Blizzard of 1888.</p>

    <p>In summary, extreme weather events, such as wildfires, floods, and storms, have significant and long-lasting impacts. They can lead to malnutrition and dehydration due to reduced access to food, water, and shelter, and increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning when power outages force people to use generators. They can also lead to disease outbreaks due to contamination of water resources. Both hot and cold weather can have long-term health effects, and the climate crisis has led to increased use of pesticides and the spread of harmful molds. These events also have a major economic impact, with recovery taking a long time.</p>
